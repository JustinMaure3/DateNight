The DateNight app was created to offer users new and fresh date ideas to spice up their love life.

With the DateNight app, users will be able to create and store their date ideas. Users will also be able to look through date ideas submitted by other users and favorite them to save for later. The search feature will display local restaurants or attractions that can be included in future date ideas. Perfect for anyone who's tired of the standard "Wine and Dine" experience.
